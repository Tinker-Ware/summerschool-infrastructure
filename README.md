# How to install React and Maintain it.

## Instructions

![#](https://a.fsdn.com/allura/p/cmdrevd/icon)
This Icon means that you need to run a command to accomplish the described task!

Every step is described, but you have to use the [Cheat sheet](https://github.com/Tinker-Ware/blog-posts/blob/summerschool/2016/07/react_sysadmin_commands.md)
to find the command that best suits for the task you want to accomplish.

Feel free to ask your mentor anything.

This is a thinking exercise. Think, then act.

Read carefully this manual, think and then apply with commands.

Make sure you understand the task. That will make everything easier!

Good luck.


**Start using your Command line terminal from here.**

BEFORE DOING ANYTHING
---

The mentors will provide the IP addresses every team should use. Wait until you have them.

Go to the folder `deploy-exercise/summerschool-infrastructure` and edit the file `Vagrantfile`.
Replace the current IPs of each machine to match the provided IPs and HOSTNAMES.

**My role:** | HOSTNAME in Vagrantifle
-------------|----------
If you're in charge of the react page(frontend) | `summerschool.react`
If you're in charge of the users microservice | `summerschool.users`
If you're in charge of the items microservice | `summerschool.items`
If you're in charge of the cart microservice | `summerschool.cart`


```
standard_machine config, 'tinkerware.react', '192.168.33.100' # Replace the IP address.
config.vm.network :public_network, ip: ip  ## CHANGE "private" for "public"
```

![](https://a.fsdn.com/allura/p/cmdrevd/icon) Go to the folder `deploy-exercise/summerschool-infrastructure` and run `vagrant up` to start your machine.

Once it's done, run:

Linux
---
From the terminal run:

```
vagrant ssh
```

Windows
---
Run [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)

  - Hostname: The ip assigned to you
  - Login user: vagrant
  - login pass: vagrant


**Welcome to your new fresh server.**

If your want to know more details about Vagrant, you can visit
the [get started page](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/)


## SERVER CONFIGURATION

You should see something like this: (After `vagrant ssh`)

```
vagrant@tinkerware:~$
```

Now you're ready to start making some noise there.

The first thing a server needs is a group of users. You don't want everyone
going all over your servers, accessing everything, wrecking stuff and leaving
your servers vulnerable!

![](https://a.fsdn.com/allura/p/cmdrevd/icon) So first thing: Create a new user. Of course a user must belong to a group.
Go ahead and create a user called `intern1` that belongs to the group `sysadmin`

Now it is time to improve the security of the people accesing our servers.
For this, we need to update the ssh deamon to be more secure.

#### Edit SSH DEAMON
Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
You can use any editor you want. If you don't know which one to use, just run:
`sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`

![](https://a.fsdn.com/allura/p/cmdrevd/icon)Add/edit the following lines:
```
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication yes
Protocol 2
AllowUsers ${USER}
```

![](https://a.fsdn.com/allura/p/cmdrevd/icon)Great. now create a secure password for new user and login to the new user
account.

![](https://a.fsdn.com/allura/p/cmdrevd/icon)Now that everything is set, we're ready to restart the ssh deamon.
`sudo service ssh restart`

As a good practice, one should normally set up the firewall as well, and
some other tasks in order to have a healthy and secure server, but we'll
leave that for another ocasion. Let's move to a deploy.

![](https://a.fsdn.com/allura/p/cmdrevd/icon)Now we need to install dependencies that our project needs, and some others
to download and manage files that are online.
`curl` is a great tool to download online resources.

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces and it's an
npm package. npm is the package manager for JavaScript.
Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight
and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of
open source libraries in the world.

![](https://a.fsdn.com/allura/p/cmdrevd/icon)In the npm documentation we can find te requirements to its installation.
In order for some npm packages to work (such as those that require building
from source), you will need to install the `build-essentials` package

![](https://a.fsdn.com/allura/p/cmdrevd/icon)Add repository and install its signing key
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | bash -

Now, we have a serer ready to host a React project.
Let's get that project to run.

Now that it's there, we need to run the service to listen to requests
and show our project to the world.

![](https://a.fsdn.com/allura/p/cmdrevd/icon)Clone the repo you're supposed to run.

- For the React page: https://github.com/Tinker-Ware/summerschool-frontend.git

- For the User microservice https://github.com/Tinker-Ware/summerschool-users-api.git

- For the Cart microservice https://github.com/Tinker-Ware/summerschool-cart-api.git

- For the Items microservice https://github.com/Tinker-Ware/summerschool-items-api.git


![](https://a.fsdn.com/allura/p/cmdrevd/icon)Now that we have all those files, in the README file are the steps
necessary to run the service. You can run it with `npm`, since we prepared
the server for that.

Great!

Visit http://192.168.33.100:3000 (Make sure you use the appropriate IP)

Review that you can see the Items, a user, and you can use the cart.
That would mean that everyone in the team did great!

And you should have a running instance of node!

Isn't it great to be a sysadmin? ... Now we need to fight with the developers
to run the code. haha....
